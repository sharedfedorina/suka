# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository contains a static website mirror created by HTTrack Website Copier. It's a local offline copy of the oversized.kopo.ua website (a Ukrainian fashion brand selling oversized t-shirts).

**Project Structure:**
- `Target/` - Root directory containing the mirrored website
  - `index.html` - HTTrack index page listing available mirrors
  - `Landing/` - Main mirrored website content
    - `oversized.kopo.ua/` - The actual website content (HTML, CSS, JS, images)
    - `connect.facebook.net/` - Cached Facebook integration scripts
    - `hts-cache/` - HTTrack cache files
    - `hts-log.txt` - HTTrack operation log

## Technology Stack

- **HTML5** - Static markup
- **CSS** - Styling (inline and external stylesheets)
- **JavaScript** - Client-side interactivity (vanilla JS)
- **Images** - GIF format assets (backblue.gif, fade.gif)

## Development

Since this is a static website mirror, there is no build process, package manager, or test suite.

**Viewing the website:**
- Open `Target/Landing/oversized.kopo.ua/index.html` in a web browser to view the mirrored site
- Or open `Target/index.html` to see the HTTrack project index

**Editing content:**
- HTML files can be edited directly in any text editor
- CSS changes should be made in referenced stylesheet files within `oversized.kopo.ua/`
- JavaScript logic is in `oversized.kopo.ua/js/` directory

## Important Notes

- This is a **static mirror**, not a live development project
- All external resources (images, scripts from cdn.facebook.com, etc.) are cached locally
- HTTrack logs and cache files should generally not be modified
- Links within the site are relative and should continue to work locally
